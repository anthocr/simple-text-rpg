# cpp-container-template

## Getting Started

This repository is compatible with [cpp-container](https://github.com/ChicoState/cpp-container). If not already built on your machine, clone and build it.

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src -it cpp-container
```

The container builds in `/tmp/text-rpg-build`, outside the mounted project.
This prevents a host-created `build/CMakeCache.txt` from being reused with
container paths. Set `BUILD_DIR` to use a different container-local build
directory if needed.

Run the application interactively in a shell:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src -it cpp-container sh
```

## Structure

* `.agents` - AI agent configurations and skills (in `/skills` subdirectory) for this project
* `.` - The root directory contains the C++ code for the application as well as necessary scripts
* `specs` - Specification documentation
* `tests` - Test code
